##Project Description

This is an interactive virtual photo album recorder which creates virtual albums with different media inputs such as photos, speech and texts. The virtual album will eventually be viewed and browsed with virtaulreality wearable lenses to navigame throughout albums, and media.  The scope of the project for this class has the following features:

1. Creation of a virtual photo album in an android tablet (nexus 5)
2. Using device camera to take photos for an event
3. GPS locations tracker for the photo
4. Speech recording and translation to text with the ability to modify/edit entered text
5. Photo album viewer with the option to visualize in a map for all the places visited in case of a trip or jorney

Eventually the app will output the photo album with recorded text and speech to a virtual reality experience using  wearable device lenses and/or synched to a smart TV app with 3D virtual reality capabilities to view the presentation but these features are out side the scope for the class project. 

## Andoird libraries used:
* Android speech
* Android Locations using Google Play Services ( 7.5.0 )

## Use case

A typical use case for this app is the creation of an album with photos and their corresponding descriptions. Each photo that is taken at a specific place can be given some description and the geolocation of the place where the photo is being taken. The description of the photo can be entered using speech recognition which is recorded in the album and translated to text.  Since geolocation information is being recorded, a map
